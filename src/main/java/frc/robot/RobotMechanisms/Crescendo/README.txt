    Welcome to the Crescendo Mechanisms sub-folder.
this contents of this file contain the code to run
the robot from the year 2024 (Epic). Each mechanism
has it's own subsystem and are all centrally controlled
by the MechanismSubsystem.  The MechanismSubsystem is
then bound by the MechanismControllerCommand.

    Please note that this is code that was adapted
from a different code layout to function with the
current code structure.  It is by no means efficient
and should NOT be used as an example on how to structure
other code in this project.
